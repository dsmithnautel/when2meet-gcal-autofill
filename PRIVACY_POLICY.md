# Privacy Policy for When2Meet Google Calendar Autofill

**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026

## Introduction
When2Meet Google Calendar Autofill ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Calendar Data
This extension accesses your Google Calendar data strictly for the purpose of identifying "busy" time slots to autofill your availability on When2Meet.
*   **What we access:** Only the "busy" status of events during the time range specified by the When2Meet event.
*   **How we use it:** We compare your busy times against the When2Meet grid to identify free slots.
*   **Where it goes:** All processing happens locally within your browser. **We do not store, share, or transmit your calendar data to any external servers.**

### User Preferences
We use local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your preferences, such as which calendars you successfully selected to include or exclude. This data never leaves your browser.

## Third-Party Services
This extension interacts directly with:
*   **Google Calendar API:** To fetch your calendar data (subject to Google's Privacy Policy).
*   **When2Meet.com:** To read the time grid and submit your availability.

## Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data. The extension operates with the minimum necessary permissions and does not include analytics or tracking scripts.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store support page.
